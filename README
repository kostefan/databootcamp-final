# Project Description

Bitcoin was the first ever decentralized cryptocurrency. It utilizes Blockchain, a distributed ledger, to ensure the accuracy and transparency of exchanges. Although it had been around for nearly a decade, it was around 2017 that Bitcoin really caught world-wide attention and we saw the prices peak. This project will describe and visualize the story behind the rise of Bitcoin and its Network, and also examine its current state.
